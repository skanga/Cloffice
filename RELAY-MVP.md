# Relay MVP Definition

> Last updated: March 24, 2026

---

## Relay = ?

**Relay is the governed operator desk for your AI agent.**

Claude Cowork is a personal AI worker for knowledge workers — cloud-hosted, Claude-only, $20-200/mo.
Paperclip is an AI company OS for autonomous businesses — 20+ agent org charts, heartbeats, company templates.

**Relay is neither.**

Relay is the self-hosted, model-agnostic, human-in-the-loop control plane for operators who run 1-3 AI agents and need real governance over what those agents do. It's the middle ground: more serious than a chatbot, more personal than a company OS.

| | Claude Cowork | Paperclip | **Relay** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **For** | Knowledge workers | Autonomous businesses | Operators / founders |
| **Agents** | 1 (Claude) | 20+ (any) | 1-3 (any) |
| **Hosting** | Anthropic cloud | Self-hosted | **Self-hosted / local-first** |
| **Model** | Claude only | Any | **Any (OpenClaw native)** |
| **Governance** | Lightweight | Full company | **Operator-grade** |
| **Core UX** | Chat + deliverables | Dashboard + tickets | **Operator desk** |
| **Price** | $20-200/mo | Free (OSS) | **Free (OSS)** |
| **Identity** | AI coworker | AI company | **AI operator desk** |

**One-line:** If OpenClaw is the engine, Relay is the cockpit.

## MVP Scope

The MVP proves one core loop:

> **Dispatch a task → agent works → operator reviews results → approves or redirects → work is done.**

Everything below serves that loop. Nothing outside it ships in MVP.

---

## MVP Features (Detailed)

### 1. Dispatch Mode (Priority: CRITICAL)

**What it is:** Assign a task to the agent and walk away. Come back to completed work.

**Current state:** Chat and Cowork pages require sitting and watching. No background execution. No task status polling. No "come back later" pattern.

**MVP scope:**
- New "Dispatch" action: user writes a task prompt, selects a working context (folder or project), hits "Dispatch"
- Task enters a queue with status: `dispatched` → `working` → `review` → `completed` / `failed`
- Gateway streams the work in the background; Relay polls for status + results
- When the agent finishes, the result appears as a reviewable deliverable (not an ephemeral chat message)
- User can review, approve, request changes, or reject
- Notification when task completes (Electron system notification)
- Task list view showing all dispatched tasks with statuses

**Key behaviors:**
- App can be minimized/backgrounded while agent works
- Results persist server-side (gateway) — not just localStorage
- Optionally, results also cached locally for offline access
- Task prompt, result, and all intermediate steps are traceable

**Implementation notes:**
- Extend gateway client with `dispatch.create`, `dispatch.status`, `dispatch.list`, `dispatch.result` RPC methods
- Add `DispatchPage` component under `src/features/dispatch/`
- Add types: `DispatchTask`, `DispatchStatus`, `DispatchResult`
- Use Electron `Notification` API for completion alerts
- Sidebar shows dispatch tasks alongside chat/cowork recents

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] User can dispatch a task and close the main window
- [ ] Task status updates in real-time when window is reopened
- [ ] Completed results are viewable with full trace
- [x] System notification fires on task completion
- [ ] Dispatched tasks persist across app restart

---

### 2. Memory → Context Injection (Priority: CRITICAL)

**What it is:** Memory entries actually affect agent behavior by being injected into the system prompt.

**Current state:** Memory page (about-me, rules, knowledge, reflection) stores entries in localStorage. They are never sent to the agent. Memory is decorative.

**MVP scope:**
- On every message send (chat, cowork, dispatch), serialize relevant memory entries into the system prompt
- Injection format: structured block at the end of the system prompt, categorized
- Categories map to injection priority:
  - `rules` → always injected (behavioral constraints)
  - `about-me` → always injected (identity/context)
  - `knowledge` → injected when relevant tags match the prompt (or always, if small enough)
  - `reflection` → injected as recent context
- Total injection budget: ~2000 tokens max. If entries exceed budget, prioritize rules > about-me > latest reflection > tagged knowledge
- Memory entries synced to gateway (if available) so Dispatch tasks also get memory context

**Implementation notes:**
- Add `buildMemoryContext(entries: MemoryEntry[]): string` function in `src/lib/memory-context.ts`
- Call before `sendMessage()` / `dispatchTask()` — prepend to system prompt
- Settings page: toggle "Inject memory into conversations" (default: on)
- Token estimation: rough character count / 4

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Memory entries appear in the system prompt sent to the agent
- [ ] Agent behavior visibly changes based on rules/about-me entries
- [ ] Memory injection can be toggled off in settings
- [ ] Works for chat, cowork, and dispatch modes

---

### 3. Cost & Token Tracking (Priority: HIGH)

**What it is:** Show the user how much each interaction costs.

**Current state:** Zero cost visibility. No token counts. No usage tracking.

**MVP scope:**
- Parse token usage from gateway response metadata (input tokens, output tokens, total)
- Display per-message token count in chat/cowork (small badge on each message)
- Session summary: total tokens used in current session
- Running total: all-time token usage (persisted in localStorage)
- If gateway provides cost data (price per token × usage), show estimated cost in USD
- Cost dashboard in sidebar or settings: daily/weekly usage chart (simple bar chart)

**Implementation notes:**
- Extend `ChatMessage` with optional `usage?: { inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number; model: string }`
- Parse from gateway stream `done` frame or response metadata
- Add `TokenBadge` component: shows token count on hover
- Add `UsageSummary` component in sidebar footer: "Session: 12.4k tokens (~$0.03)"
- Persist daily totals in localStorage keyed by date

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every assistant message shows token count
- [ ] Session total visible in sidebar
- [ ] Running total persisted across sessions
- [ ] Cost estimate shown when price data available

---

### 4. Approval Gates (Wired) (Priority: HIGH)

**What it is:** When the agent wants to perform a dangerous action, Relay pauses and asks the operator for approval.

**Current state:** Safety page defines 12 permission scopes with risk levels — but nothing is enforced. Agents act without approval.

**MVP scope:**
- When the agent response contains a `relay_action` flagged as requiring approval (based on Safety page scope settings), Relay:
  1. Pauses execution
  2. Shows an approval card: action type, target path, risk level, details
  3. Operator clicks Approve, Reject, or Modify
  4. If approved → execute action, send receipt
  5. If rejected → send rejection message to agent, agent can adjust
- Scope mapping (from existing Safety page):
  - `file_delete` → approval if enabled
  - `file_write_outside_workspace` → approval if enabled
  - `shell_execute` → always approval (critical)
  - `network_request` → approval if enabled
  - `data_export` → approval if enabled
- Approval decisions logged in Activity page as auditable events

**Implementation notes:**
- Add `ApprovalGate` component: intercepts relay_actions before execution
- Modify cowork/dispatch action execution pipeline to check scope permissions
- Add `ApprovalDecision` type: `{ actionId, scope, decision: 'approved'|'rejected'|'modified', timestamp, reason? }`
- Store decisions in activity history
- Sound/notification for pending approvals

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] File delete actions pause for approval when scope is enabled
- [ ] Approval card shows action details and risk level
- [ ] Approved actions execute; rejected actions notify the agent
- [ ] All decisions appear in Activity log
- [ ] At least 3 scope types enforced (file_delete, shell, network)

---

### 5. Schedule Creation (Priority: HIGH)

**What it is:** Users can create recurring tasks from the UI, not just view existing cron jobs.

**Current state:** Schedule page displays cron jobs from gateway (read-only). No creation UI.

**MVP scope:**
- "New scheduled task" button on Schedule page
- Form fields:
  - Task name
  - Task prompt (what the agent should do)
  - Schedule: preset options (every hour, daily at 9am, weekly Monday, custom cron)
  - Working context (folder/workspace)
  - Enabled toggle
- On save → send to gateway via `cron.create` RPC
- Edit existing: click a job → edit form pre-filled → `cron.update` RPC
- Delete: context menu → `cron.delete` RPC
- Visual confirmation: newly created jobs appear in the timeline/calendar view

**Implementation notes:**
- Add `ScheduleFormDialog` component with shadcn Dialog + form
- Add cron expression builder (preset buttons + freeform input for advanced)
- Extend gateway client: `createCronJob()`, `updateCronJob()`, `deleteCronJob()`
- Validate cron expression client-side before sending

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] User can create a new scheduled task from the UI
- [ ] Preset schedule options work (daily, weekly, custom)
- [ ] Created jobs appear in schedule view
- [ ] Jobs can be edited and deleted
- [ ] Jobs actually execute on schedule (gateway-dependent)

---

### 6. Connector Framework (Priority: HIGH)

**What it is:** A pluggable system for connecting Relay to external tools.

**Current state:** Settings page has a "Connectors" placeholder. Zero integration logic.

**MVP scope (3 connectors for MVP):**

**Framework:**
- Connector interface: `{ id, name, icon, status, configure(), test(), actions[] }`
- Connector registry in settings: list installed connectors, add new ones
- Each connector provides actions the agent can invoke (e.g., `slack.send_message`, `github.create_issue`)
- Connector actions exposed to the agent via gateway RPC extensions or system prompt injection

**MVP Connectors:**

1. **File System (local)** — already built, formalize as connector
   - Actions: read, write, list, delete, rename, stat
   - Status: working

2. **Web Fetch** — simple HTTP GET/POST
   - Actions: `web.fetch(url)` → returns page content
   - Configuration: allowed domains list (safety)
   - Use case: research, API calls, checking services

3. **Shell / Terminal** — execute commands in working directory
   - Actions: `shell.exec(command)` → returns stdout/stderr
   - Configuration: allowed commands list, blocked commands, timeout
   - Approval gate: always requires approval (critical scope)
   - Use case: run tests, build projects, git operations

**Future connectors (not MVP):** Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Notion, Calendar

**Implementation notes:**
- Create `src/lib/connectors/` with connector interface + registry
- Each connector is a module: `src/lib/connectors/filesystem.ts`, `web-fetch.ts`, `shell.ts`
- Connector status shown in Settings → Connectors tab
- Agent-facing: connector actions described in system prompt so agent knows what tools are available

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Connector interface defined and documented
- [x] File system connector formalized
- [x] Web fetch connector works with domain allowlist
- [x] Shell connector works with approval gate enforcement
- [x] Settings page shows connector status and configuration
- [ ] Agent can discover and invoke connector actions

---

### 7. Persistent Threads (Server-Side) (Priority: MEDIUM)

**What it is:** Chat/cowork/dispatch history stored on the gateway, not just localStorage.

**Current state:** All threads and messages persisted in localStorage. Lost if browser data clears. Can't sync across devices. Dispatch won't work without server-side persistence.

**MVP scope:**
- On message send/receive, persist to gateway via `thread.save` RPC
- On app load, restore from gateway via `thread.list`, `thread.get`
- localStorage as cache/fallback — gateway as source of truth
- Thread metadata: id, title, type (chat/cowork/dispatch), created, updated, message count
- Graceful degradation: if gateway unavailable, use localStorage only

**Implementation notes:**
- Extend gateway client: `saveThread()`, `listThreads()`, `getThread()`, `deleteThread()`
- Add sync logic in App.tsx: on mount → pull thread list from gateway → merge with localStorage
- Conflict resolution: gateway wins (newer timestamp)
- Migration: first run after update → push existing localStorage threads to gateway

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Threads persist on gateway
- [ ] App can restore threads from gateway on fresh install
- [ ] localStorage acts as cache
- [ ] Works offline (falls back to localStorage)
- [ ] Thread deletion syncs both sides

---

### 8. Artifact Panel (Priority: MEDIUM)

**What it is:** Rich output display for agent deliverables beyond plain markdown.

**Current state:** Cowork right panel shows local file action buttons only. Chat has no right panel. Agent output is always rendered as markdown.

**MVP scope:**
- When agent produces a file (via relay_action `create_file`), display it in the right panel:
  - Code files: syntax-highlighted viewer
  - HTML: sandboxed iframe preview
  - CSV/JSON: table view
  - Markdown: rendered preview
  - Images: display
- Panel shows a tab per artifact (multiple outputs per task)
- Each artifact has: download button, copy button, "apply to workspace" button
- Panel persists per session — switching back to a completed task shows its artifacts

**Implementation notes:**
- Create `ArtifactPanel` component in `src/features/cowork/artifact-panel.tsx`
- Create `ArtifactViewer` with type-specific renderers
- Wire to relay_action receipts: when `create_file` succeeds, add to artifact list
- Use `iframe sandbox` for HTML preview (security)
- Tab bar with filename + icon

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Created files appear as artifacts in the right panel
- [ ] Code files render with syntax highlighting
- [ ] HTML files render in sandboxed preview
- [ ] Artifacts can be downloaded
- [ ] Multiple artifacts per session supported

## What is NOT in the MVP

| Excluded | Why |
|---|---|
| Multi-agent orchestration / org charts | That's Paperclip's territory |
| Drag-and-drop workflow builder | Against product philosophy |
| Mobile companion app | Post-MVP; Dispatch + Electron notifications cover the core need first |
| Multi-workspace switching | Post-MVP; focus on single workspace excellence |
| Slack/GitHub/Notion connectors | Post-MVP; framework ships in MVP, specific integrations follow |
| Agent-to-agent delegation | Post-MVP; single-operator, 1-3 agent model first |
| User accounts / team features | Post-MVP; single-operator use case first |
| Custom themes beyond light/dark | Cosmetic, not functional |
| Plugin marketplace | Post-MVP; plugin system exists server-side already |

---

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is done when a user can:

1. **Open Relay** and connect to an OpenClaw gateway
2. **Set up memory** with their name, role, rules, and domain knowledge
3. **Dispatch a task** ("Organize my downloads folder by file type") and close the window
4. **Get notified** when the task is done
5. **Review the results** — see what files were moved, read the agent's reasoning
6. **Approve a dangerous action** — agent wants to delete duplicates, Relay pauses and asks
7. **See what it cost** — 8,400 tokens, ~$0.02
8. **Schedule a recurring task** ("Every Monday, scan my project for TODO comments and create a summary")
9. **Use a connector** — agent runs `shell.exec("npm test")` with approval
10. **Trust the audit trail** — every action, approval, and result is logged in Activity

That's the loop. That's the MVP. Everything else is iteration.

## Build Order

| Phase | Features | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Memory → context injection | Nothing (standalone) |
| **Phase 1** | Cost/token tracking | Nothing (parse gateway responses) |
| **Phase 2** | Approval gates (wired) | Safety page data (exists) |
| **Phase 2** | Connector framework + shell/web-fetch | Approval gates (shell needs approval) |
| **Phase 3** | Persistent threads (server-side) | Gateway RPC extensions |
| **Phase 3** | Schedule creation | Gateway RPC extensions |
| **Phase 4** | Dispatch mode | Persistent threads + memory injection + approval gates |
| **Phase 4** | Artifact panel | Dispatch results + connector outputs |

Phase 1 is pure frontend. Ship it in days.
Phase 2 is frontend + Electron bridge. Ship it in a week.
Phase 3 requires gateway cooperation. Ship when gateway RPCs land.
Phase 4 is the capstone. Dispatch is the product-defining feature.

## Positioning Summary

> **Claude Cowork** = a personal AI worker for knowledge workers ($20-200/mo, cloud, Claude-only)
>
> **Paperclip** = an AI company OS for autonomous businesses (open-source, 20+ agents, zero-human)
>
> **Relay** = the governed operator desk for your AI agent (self-hosted, model-agnostic, human-in-the-loop)

Relay's moat: **governance + local-first + model freedom.** You own your data, you choose your model, you approve every important action. Claude Cowork can't promise local-first. Paperclip is overkill for one operator with one agent. Relay is the right tool for the right scale.

# SeventeenLabs Business Model & Monetization Strategy

> How SeventeenLabs earns money with Relay and the broader product platform.

---

## The Core Thesis

**Businesses that want AI in their operations but don't want to use Claude Cowork (or can't).**

Why can't they / won't they use Claude Cowork?

| Reason | Who | Size |
|---|---|---|
| **Data sovereignty** | Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal, gov), EU companies with GDPR concerns | Large |
| **Model lock-in** | Companies that want to use multiple models, fine-tuned models, or open-weight models | Growing fast |
| **Cost control** | Teams burning $200/mo/seat on Claude Max and wanting their own infrastructure | Medium |
| **Customization** | Companies needing deep integration with proprietary systems, not generic connectors | Large |
| **Compliance** | Organizations requiring audit trails, approval workflows, and governance that Claude Cowork's lightweight controls don't cover | Enterprise |
| **Ownership** | Founders/CTOs who philosophically want to own their AI stack, not rent it | Indie/SMB |

These are SeventeenLabs customers.

---

## Revenue Model: Open Core + Services

Relay is open-source (MIT). This is correct and should stay. The OSS version is the acquisition engine. Revenue comes from everything around it.

### Revenue Stream 1: Relay Pro / Enterprise (Software License)

**The n8n / Windmill model** — free self-hosted, paid for enterprise features.

| | Relay Community (Free) | Relay Pro | Relay Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $0 | ~€49-99/mo per operator | Custom (€500+/mo) |
| **Hosting** | Self-hosted | Self-hosted | Self-hosted or managed |
| **Core features** | Chat, Cowork, Dispatch, Files, Memory, Activity, Schedule, Safety | Everything in Community | Everything in Pro |
| **Connectors** | File system, Shell, Web fetch | + Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Notion, Calendar, CRM | + Custom connector SDK, unlimited |
| **Governance** | Basic approval gates | + Role-based approvals, approval chains, delegation rules | + Multi-approver workflows, compliance templates, policy engine |
| **Audit** | Activity log (local) | + Persistent audit trail, export to CSV/JSON | + Immutable audit log, log streaming (Datadog, etc.), retention policies |
| **Memory** | localStorage | + Gateway-synced memory, team memory sharing | + Org-wide knowledge base, memory governance |
| **Cost tracking** | Per-message token counts | + Budgets per workspace, alerts, daily/weekly reports | + Cost allocation by team/project, billing integration |
| **Schedule** | View + create | + Advanced cron, conditional triggers, dependency chains | + SLA monitoring, escalation rules |
| **Multi-workspace** | Single workspace | + Up to 5 workspaces | + Unlimited, workspace templates |
| **Users** | Single operator | + Up to 5 operators | + Unlimited, SSO/SAML, SCIM |
| **Support** | Community (Discord/GitHub) | Email support, 48h response | Dedicated Slack, SLA, onboarding |

**Why this works:** n8n does €30M+ ARR with this model. Windmill charges €120/mo for enterprise. The free tier gets adoption; paid tiers capture value when companies need governance, compliance, team features, and support.

**Key pricing insight:** Don't charge per AI execution or per token — that competes with the model provider. Charge per **operator seat** and **feature tier**. The value is governance, not compute.

---

### Revenue Stream 2: Core Platform (The Backend)

SeventeenLabs already has a "Core" product on the website: *"The Core platform unifies company context, governance, and agentic execution into a controllable operating layer for AI."*

**Core is the server-side counterpart to Relay.** Relay is the cockpit; Core is the flight computer.

| What Core provides | Why it's paid |
|---|---|
| Context layer API — unified company data, goals, constraints, team structure | Companies don't want to build this themselves |
| Governance engine — approval workflows, policy rules, role-based access | Compliance teams require this |
| Agent orchestration — manage 2-10 agents across projects with state, retries, rollback | Operational reliability |
| Enterprise memory — searchable, permissioned, org-wide knowledge store | IP protection and institutional memory |
| Observability — quality metrics, drift detection, latency, cost per workflow | Exec reporting |

**Pricing:** Platform license. €200-2,000/mo depending on scale. Sold alongside Relay Enterprise or standalone.

**This is the real business.** Relay gets you in the door. Core is the platform companies pay for long-term.

---

### Revenue Stream 3: Implementation Services (Professional Services)

SeventeenLabs already positions as "Partnership Over Consulting" with proven results (€50k+ average annual ROI per client, 40% time saved, 3-6 months to deploy).

| Service | Price range | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Operations Audit** | €3,000-8,000 | Assess current workflows, identify automation opportunities, produce prioritized roadmap |
| **Relay Deployment** | €5,000-15,000 | Install, configure, connect to existing stack, train team, first 3 workflows live |
| **Custom Connector Build** | €2,000-10,000 per connector | Build custom connectors for proprietary or niche systems (ERP, CRM, internal tools) |
| **Governance Design** | €5,000-20,000 | Design approval workflows, permission scopes, compliance templates, audit requirements |
| **AI Agent Setup** | €3,000-15,000 | Configure OpenClaw or other agents with business-specific context, memory, skills, and safety rules |
| **Ongoing Operations** | €2,000-5,000/mo retainer | Monitor, optimize, expand — fractional AI operations team |

**Why this works:** The website already claims 12+ opportunities found per audit. This is the fastest path to revenue while the product matures. Services fund product development.

**Margin structure:** Services are 60-70% margin (it's your time + AI leverage). Software is 80-90% margin at scale. Services first, product revenue compounds over time.

---

### Revenue Stream 4: Workflow Templates & Marketplace (Future)

Similar to Paperclip's "ClipMart" concept but for operator workflows, not company templates.

| Asset type | Example | Price model |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflow templates** | "Weekly stakeholder report from Slack + GitHub + Linear" | Free (acquisition) or $19-49 per premium template |
| **Connector packs** | Industry-specific connector bundles (Legal pack: Clio + DocuSign + iManage) | €29-99/mo subscription |
| **Governance templates** | SOC2-ready approval workflows, GDPR data handling rules, HIPAA compliance gates | €99-299 per template pack |
| **Skills marketplace** | Community-contributed agent skills with revenue share | 70/30 creator split |

**Timeline:** Post-MVP. Requires adoption first. But design Relay's connector and template interfaces now to enable this later.

---

## Competitive Moat Against Claude Cowork

This is the central strategic question: **Why would a business pay SeventeenLabs when they can just use Claude Cowork at $20-200/mo per person?**

### What Claude Cowork CANNOT offer:

| Capability | Claude Cowork | Relay + Core |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted / on-prem** | No. Your data goes to Anthropic. | Yes. Data stays on your infrastructure. |
| **Model choice** | Claude only | Any model: GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral, Gemini, fine-tuned models |
| **Custom governance** | "Shows you the plan, waits for approval" — one-size-fits-all | Configurable per scope, per role, per risk level, with audit trails |
| **Cost predictability** | Rate-limited, opaque pricing, "consumes limits faster" | Pay for your own compute; full token/cost visibility |
| **Enterprise compliance** | Limited audit trail, no SOC2-specific controls | Immutable audit logs, compliance templates, log streaming |
| **Team memory / org knowledge** | Per-user only | Shared, permissioned, org-wide knowledge base |
| **Custom integrations** | 80+ plugins (but Anthropic-controlled ecosystem) | Build your own connectors; no platform dependency |
| **Offline / air-gapped** | No | Yes (local-first architecture) |
| **White-label / embed** | No | Yes (Enterprise tier) |

### The pitch to businesses:

> "Claude Cowork is great for individual knowledge workers. But if your company needs to own its AI infrastructure, choose its own models, enforce real governance, and keep data on-prem — you need Relay."

## Go-to-Market Sequence

### Phase 1: Services-Led (Now → 6 months)
- Lead with AI Operations Audits and Relay Deployments
- Every services engagement produces a live Relay installation
- Charge for the work, give Relay Community Edition for free
- Build case studies and proven ROI metrics
- **Revenue: €5-15k per engagement, 2-4 clients/month = €10-60k/mo**

### Phase 2: Product-Led (6-12 months)
- Launch Relay Pro with team features, advanced connectors, and persistent audit
- Self-serve signup → download → connect gateway → upgrade when needed
- Services clients become Pro/Enterprise upgrades automatically
- **Revenue: €49-99/mo × growing operator base + services pipeline**

### Phase 3: Platform-Led (12-18 months)
- Launch Core as the backend platform
- Sell Relay + Core as a stack to mid-market companies
- Partner channel: agencies and consultants deploy Relay + Core for their clients
- Connector and governance template marketplace opens
- **Revenue: Platform licenses + marketplace take rate + partner revenue share**

## Pricing Sanity Check

| Comparison | Their price | What they offer | Relay equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Cowork Max | $200/mo/seat | Single AI worker, cloud | Relay Pro at €49-99/mo gives more governance + model freedom |
| n8n Business | €667/mo | Workflow automation, 40k executions | Relay Enterprise at similar range gives AI-native operations |
| Windmill Enterprise | €120/mo + compute | Developer workflows | Similar tier, different audience (ops vs. dev) |
| Paperclip | Free (OSS) | Full company OS | Relay Community is free too; Pro/Enterprise for governance |

**Key insight:** Relay Pro at €49-99/mo is cheaper than Claude Cowork Max ($200/mo) AND gives you data ownership + model choice. That's a real value pitch.

---

## What SeventeenLabs is NOT

- Not a model lab (don't build or train models)
- Not an agent framework (don't tell people how to build agents)
- Not a chatbot company (Relay is an operator desk, not a chat interface)
- Not a consulting-only shop (services fund the product, but the product is the business)

## What SeventeenLabs IS

**An AI operations company that helps businesses integrate AI into daily operations with governance and control.**

- **Relay** = the governed operator desk (open-source desktop app)
- **Core** = the AI operations platform (server-side, paid)
- **Services** = the implementation partner that deploys and configures it all
- **Marketplace** = the ecosystem where governance templates, connectors, and skills compound

The revenue ladder: **Services → Relay Pro → Core Platform → Marketplace**. Each rung funds the next and builds on the last.
